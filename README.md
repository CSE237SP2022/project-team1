A calorie counter application that can store and provide information
about a user's food intake. 

User Stories
- Users who wish to have a working record of their food intake can track each food they eat
- Users who wish to view total stats for a particular day can see their cumulative calories,
  carbs, fat, and protein for a session
  
Current Issues
- Counter currently tracks total cumulative calories, but does not reset yet (like reset after a day)
- Counter also does not save the total cumulative calorie data session to session, so it only tracks total statistics per session
 
Future Implementations
- Recognize when a food has already been entered and remember its statistics so the user
  will not have to repeat/enter anything other than its name
- Further condense code by placing more of it in separate methods
- Store information in a file so that a user can access it later as opposed to losing
  statistics after ending the program
- Store food information based on the current day
  
Run Instructions
  1. In a terminal window, clone the repository using the git clone command
  2. To execute, enter command './run.sh'
